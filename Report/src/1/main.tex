\chapter{Status}

This calendar implementation in Smalltalk is both runnable and satisfies all parts of the given assignment in regard to functionalities and such.
However the output, i.e. a HTML representation of a given calendar, is done without using \textit{Seaside}, and thus is rather simple.
This was done because of the time constraint of 23 hours to be spent on the entire second mini--project.

\medskip
The program is written in Smalltalk using the \textit{Pharo} environment, without use of any third party libraries libraries.
This means that only libraries already part of the \textit{Pharo} environment, such as \texttt{Timespan}, was used.
All development was done on \textit{Windows 10} in \textit{Pharo} version 5.0.

\medskip
The program works as prescribed in the assignment, however, some assumptions were made during development.
These assumptions will be elaborated upon in the \textbf{Overview} chapter of this report.

The included HTML file represents a calendar which is identical to that of the one made in the file \texttt{test\_calendar}.
To use this test calendar you must paste it into the \textit{Workspace} of the \textit{Pharo} environment.
